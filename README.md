# homie-ui

Very basic Homie (https://github.com/marvinroger/homie) javascript interface.
OTA is supported using a specific method to publish the firmware via mqtt. I will remove that in the future (a allow a user to upload a binary file from the UI), so I won't document the required setup.

This project is also for me a way to learn using VueJS, so beware, there be dragons.
